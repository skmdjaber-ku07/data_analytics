# Random Forest

The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 89%, indicating that the model can make accurate predictions based on the given input. The model's precision and recall scores were also calculated to be 0.88 and 0.90

# Linear Regression

Linear regression was implemented on the given CSV dataset, and the algorithm was able to predict the median house value based on the other features in the dataset. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the linear regression model was 0.65, which indicates that the model's predictions are generally close to the actual values.

# LSTM

The script first loads the dataset as a CSV file using the Pandas library. It then preprocesses the data by normalizing it to a range between 0 and 1 using the MinMaxScaler from the scikit-learn library.

# K-means Clustering
This project provides a straightforward implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm in Python using the scikit-learn library. It could be further improved by incorporating additional clustering evaluation metrics and exploring different initialization methods to improve clustering performance.
