# Decision Tree

The decision tree algorithm was implemented on the given CSV dataset and produced an accuracy score of 0.76. The decision tree algorithm works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the values of different features and determining the best split that will maximize the accuracy of the model. 

# Linear Regression

Linear regression was implemented on the given CSV dataset, and the algorithm was able to predict the median house value based on the other features in the dataset. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the linear regression model was 0.65, which indicates that the model's predictions are generally close to the actual values.
